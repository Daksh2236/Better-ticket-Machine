47. The balance doesn't change when you you get an error message
    My prediction was right it gives you a message saying you need to insert more money
48. I dont think it will have any effect because it will be as if we are able to put no money
    It doesn't make a differnce on the behavior of the method
50. In the figures project the boolean value was makeVisible it was well suited because it was either we wanted to see the circle or not
51. The difference between the print in the naive and better ticket machine is that in the naive its set to when you print it sets your balance
    to 0 unlike the better it js substracts from the the price from the balance
52. When you try to print a ticket it is not able to print
53. After a ticket is printed it cannot have a negative value because for the ticket to be albe to print it needs to atleast have the same 
    value as the price or more.
