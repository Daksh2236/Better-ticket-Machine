47. The balance doesn't change when you you get an error message
    My prediction was right it gives you a message saying you need to insert more money

48. I dont think it will have any effect because it will be as if we are able to put no money
    It doesn't make a differnce on the behavior of the method

50. In the figures project the boolean value was makeVisible it was well suited because it was either we wanted to see the circle or not

51. The difference between the print in the naive and better ticket machine is that in the naive its set to when you print it sets your balance
    to 0 unlike the better it js substracts from the the price from the balance

52. When you try to print a ticket it is not able to print

53. After a ticket is printed it cannot have a negative value because for the ticket to be albe to print it needs to atleast have the same 
    value as the price or more.

59.  public int refundBalance()
     {
     }
     balance = 0;
     return balance; 
     This version does not give the same result because it is missing some assignment statements.
     To test this you can replace the original code with the one above and you will see that you will not be able to compile it

60. When you try to compile with the version in question 59 (above) you get an error message saying undeclared variable: amountToRefund
    This version is not able to compile because the return statement because it does have a variable that it can return to
    That is why it is supposed to have amountToRefund = balance; and the variable to define the variable it would need to be int amountToRefund;
